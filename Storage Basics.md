    # Physical storage
    # Differentiate between types of storage
        * Single Disk Drive
        * JBOD (DAS: Direct Attach Storage)
        * Volume
        * Storage Array
        * SCSI device (by which can connect physically hardisk connect, it support 32 disk)
        * DAS
        * NAS (Network Attach Storage: mainly working on ip protocol)
        * SAN (Fiber channel, Fiber channel over ethernet)
        * iSCSI (internet small computer system interface)

    # Storage Protocols
        * IFCSI (for windows purpose)
        * FC
        * NFS (Network file sharing for Linux)

Disk is measure in IOPS(Input Output operation per second)

data-transfer rate:
the rate at which data can be retrieve
sata is interface pc to raid controller, category which used in laptop and desktop
current standard is 3GB
7200 rotation per minute

7200 rpm in NLSAS

SAS two standard
6 Gbps
10k rotation per minute
15k is standard rotation per minute


Hot SWap is feature which will allow disk can be removed when its working and replcace with new disk, no need to turn off disk.

Disk failure calculated by MTTF (mean time to failure)
